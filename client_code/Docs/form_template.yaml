              content: "#### Absentee Owners\nWhat it is\nThe Absentee Owners dataset identifies properties where the owner does not live at the property. In industry terms, these are non-owner-occupied or “absentee” owners—people or entities that hold title but reside elsewhere (e.g., landlords, second-home owners, inherited estates). \n\nHow we build it\nPublic assessor/tax-roll records keep two different addresses for each parcel: a situs (property) address and an owner mailing address. When those two don’t match, it’s a strong, widely used signal that the property is not owner-occupied. Our list is generated by comparing the owner’s mailing address to the property’s situs address and flagging mismatches as “absentee.” (County assessors document the distinction between situs and mailing addresses; they may legitimately differ.)\n\nWhy investors care\n\n- Off-market lead generation: Non-owner-occupied properties are a classic source of seller leads for investors and agents, because owners aren’t living there (common cases: rentals, inherited, second homes). Outreach often happens via direct mail or targeted campaigns. \n\n- Landlord/portfolio targeting: Many absentee owners are landlords; segmenting by length of ownership and equity can surface potential sellers (e.g., tired landlords, hold periods expiring). \n\n- Out-of-state owners: Filtering for owners outside the property’s state helps find owners who may be less attached to the asset or less familiar with local management headaches. \n\n- Campaign precision: Combining “absentee” with last sale date, assessed value, beds/baths/SF, and map location lets you focus on the zip codes and property profiles that match your buy box."

              content: "#### Data Columns\n- Address — Street address of the property (situs), i.e., the physical location of the parcel; different from the owner’s mailing address. \n\n- City / County / State — Jurisdiction of the property’s situs address used for location, taxing authority, and regional filtering. \n\n- OwnerName — Name of the recorded owner (person or entity) per county assessor records.\n\n- OwnerAddress / OwnerCity / OwnerState / OwnerZip — The owner’s mailing address the Assessor keeps on file; it can differ from the property’s situs address. For ZIP formatting, USPS uses 5-digit ZIP or ZIP+4. \n\n- BuildingDescription — Short assessor/use description of the improvements (e.g., single-family, condo, commercial), often derived from building/use class codes. \n\n- SF — Reported building square footage. For homes this often aligns with gross living area (finished, above-grade living space) depending on jurisdiction/standard. \n\n- Bedrooms / Bathrooms — Count of finished bedrooms and baths recorded by the Assessor as property characteristics. \n\n- YearBuilt — Year construction of the primary building was completed (some jurisdictions note it may be approximate for older structures). \n\n- AssessedValue — Value the Assessor uses for property taxation. In Colorado, assessed value = actual (market) value × the statutory assessment rate. \n\n- LastSalesPrice — Consideration recorded for the most recent arm’s-length sale of the property (per county sales records). \n\n- LastSalesDate — Recording/transfer date of the most recent sale captured in assessor/recorder sales data. \n\n- LAT / LON — Geographic coordinates of the property (typically in decimal degrees) used for mapping and spatial filters."
